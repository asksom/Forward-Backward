# Forward-Backward
Simple implementation of the forward-backward algorithm for TDT4171: Methods in AI

The Forward-Backward algorithm consists of two parts, the forward algorithm used for filtering, a process to recursively compute the joint probability of P(x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>1:t</sub>) and
the backward algorithm used for smoothing, a process that moves backwards to edit the probabilities to more accurate values.
